# DNN training and compression

The example for DNN training and compression is based on 1D signal classification. 

### Files:
- compression.ipynb: Main Jupyter Notebook file to perform model training and compression.

### Folder: 
- src folder: contains source codes that correspond to auxiliary functions.
- tuner folder: temporal folder to store intermediate results generated by the tuner to obtain the hyperparameters defining the student architecture.
- tuner_teacher: temporal folder to store intermediate results generated by the tuner to obtain the hyperparameters defining the teacher architecture.
