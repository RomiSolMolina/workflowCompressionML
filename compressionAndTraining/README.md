# DNN training and compression

### Files:
- compression.ipynb: Main Jupyter Notebook file to perform model training and compression.

### Folders: 

- src folder: contains source codes that correspond to auxiliary functions.
- tuner folder: a temporal folder will be created to store intermediate results generated by the tuner to obtain the hyperparameters defining the student architecture.
- tuner_teacher: a temporal folder will be created to store intermediate results generated by the tuner to obtain the hyperparameters defining the teacher architecture.

### Datasets

- Custom datasets will be provided under request.
- The methodology can be implemented using SOTA datasets.
