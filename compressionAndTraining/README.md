# DNN training and compression

### Folders: 

- src folder: contains source codes that correspond to auxiliary functions.
- tuner folder: a temporal folder will be created to store intermediate results generated by the tuner to obtain the hyperparameters defining the student architecture.
- tuner_teacher: a temporal folder will be created to store intermediate results generated by the tuner to obtain the hyperparameters defining the teacher architecture.

### Datasets

- Custom datasets will be provided under request.
- The methodology can be implemented using SOTA datasets.


### Files:

- **config.py**: a configuration file to set different variables that are part of the process of the DNN training and compression. The user should modify this file based on his specifications.

- **compressionMain.ipynb**: main Jupyter Notebook file to perform model training and compression.

- **compressionStart.py**: a file that contains the selection flow based on the type of signal (1d or 2D).

- Severals **templates** are provided to define the network topologies and to perform the hyperparameters optimization and training:
    - For 1D signals:
      
    - For 2D signals:
