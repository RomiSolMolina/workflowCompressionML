# DNN training and compression

The example for DNN training and compression is based on 1D signal classification

Files:
- compression.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for training, compression, and hls4ml integration
- src folder: contains source codes for auxiliar functions
- tuner folder: temporal folder to store intermediate results generated by the tuner to obtain the hyperparameters that will define the student architecture
- tuner_teacher: temporal folder to store intermediate results generated by the tuner to obtain the hyperparameters that will define the teacher architecture
